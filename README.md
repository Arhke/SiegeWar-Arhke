# SiegeWar
A war add-on plugin for Towny.


Welcome to the WIP Readme for SiegeWar. SiegeWar is an ambitious war idea developed by [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1) over the course of about a year starting in the fall of 2019. Goosius has been on hiatus since September 2020. As of January 5, 2021 Goosius has accepted his invite from the TownyAdvanced org and is a Maintainer of this repo. He will be coding on his own schedule.

Originally SiegeWar was a fork of Towny, being built by Goosius directly into Towny. This was necessary because Towny did not have a sufficient API to allow for the things SiegeWar wanted to do.

This repo is for the stand-alone SiegeWar.jar, the result of roughly 2 months of work separating SiegeWar from Towny. This included:
  - updating/merging the SiegeWar branch of Towny from 0.96.2.8 all the way up to 0.96.5.12,
  - adding in many, many API events to Towny,
  - changing the entire Siege database to operate on Town metadata.

If you're after the old Towny-with-Siege-War-built-in, you can find the last version I made [here](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/files/5766604/Towny-SeigeWar-0.96.5.12-SNAPSHOT%2B512690a.jar.zip). 

Going forward development is occuring solely on the stand-alone SiegeWar.jar which can be run alongside any modern version of Towny. You can get the latest downloads on the [Release page](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/SiegeWar/releases).
