# SiegeWar
A war add-on plugin for Towny.


Welcome to the WIP Readme for SiegeWar. SiegeWar is an ambitious war idea developed by [Goosius1](https://github.com/Goosius1) over the course of about a year starting in the fall of 2019. Goosius has been on hiatus since September 2020.

Originally SiegeWar was a fork of Towny, being built by Goosius directly into Towny. This was necessary because Towny did not have a sufficient API to allow for the things SiegeWar wanted to do.

This repo is for the stand-alone SiegeWar.jar, the result of a little over a month of work separating SiegeWar from Towny. This included:
  - updating/merging the SiegeWar branch of Towny from 0.96.2.8 all the way up to 0.96.5.12.
  - adding in many, many API events to Towny,
  - changing the entire Siege database to operate on Town metadata,

If you're after the old Towny-with-Siege-War-built-in, you can find the last version I made [here](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/files/5766604/Towny-SeigeWar-0.96.5.12-SNAPSHOT%2B512690a.jar.zip). 

Going forward development is occuring solely on the stand-alone SiegeWar.jar which can be run alongside any modern version of Towny. You can get the latest downloads on the [Release page](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/SiegeWar/releases).
